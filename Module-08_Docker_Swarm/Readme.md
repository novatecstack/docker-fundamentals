# 8.1 Docker Swarm Overview
  - Docker Swarm is an orchestration management tool that runs on Docker applications. 
  - It helps end-users in creating and deploying a cluster of Docker nodes.
  - Each node of a Docker Swarm is a Docker daemon, and all Docker daemons interact using the Docker API. 
  - Each container within the Swarm can be deployed and accessed by nodes of the same cluster.
