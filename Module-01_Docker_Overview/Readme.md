# Docker Overview

## What is Docker?
   - Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications
   - Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly
   - With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications
   - By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production
   - Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a Container
   - The isolation and security allow you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host
