## What is Docker?
   - **Docker** is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.
   - **Docker** enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.
   - **Docker** is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called **Containers**.
   - The service has both free and premium tiers. 
   - The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine. 
   - It was first started in 2013 and is developed by Docker, Inc


## Why use Docker?
   - With **Docker**, you can manage your infrastructure in the same way you manage your applications
   - By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production
   - Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a Container
   - The isolation and security allow you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host


## What is a Docker Container?

   - A **Container** is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. 
   - A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

## Advantages of running application in Docker Containers
   1. **Standard**: Docker created the industry standard for containers, so they could be portable anywhere
   2. **Lightweight**: Containers share the machine’s OS system kernel and therefore do not require an OS per application, driving higher server efficiencies and reducing server and licensing costs
   3. **Secure**: Applications are safer in containers and Docker provides the strongest default isolation capabilities in the industry
   4. Loosely coupled
   5. Scalable
